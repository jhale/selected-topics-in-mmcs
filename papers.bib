General theoretical analysis of the numerical process. Numerical experiments with linear and nonlinear, elliptic and mixed-type (transonic flow) problems--confirm theoretical predictions.

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

	abstract = {The concept of isogeometric analysis is proposed. Basis functions generated from NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are employed to construct an exact geometric model. For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection–diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages.},
