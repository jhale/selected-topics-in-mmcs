### Description

In this seminar series we will discover some classic papers that have had a
huge impact on the field of Industrial Mathematics. As well as understanding
the technical content of the papers, you will be encouraged to form a broader
view of the history of the field, to understand the context of these important
developments, and to see how those advances have influenced modern industrial
practice. The course and its content will be student-led following the
framework outlined below.

### Assessment

Due to the collaborative nature of the course, attendance is mandatory
according to the UL Study Regulations. Excuses must be made via email in
advance of the session.

Each student will select a paper. They will be the project leader for their
chosen paper. Every student is expected to contribute fully to delivering on
the coursework for each paper, following the overall directions of the project
leader.

My expectation is that all students will collaborate fully on the course and
produce high quality work. If you are not meeting expectations, I will contact
you via email during the course. If the issue does not improve, I will deduct
marks on an individual basis.

Students will be jointly assessed on the following pieces of coursework. There
is no examination.

The reports should consist of:

1. A written report of approximately ten A4 pages that touches equally on the
   five roles detailed below. The report should be prepared using LaTeX.

2. Supporting code examples should be uploaded to a GitHub repository and 
   results placed directly in the report.

3. Joint presentation of 25 minutes plus a question and answer session.

The reports should be submitted by the project lead as a PDF and, if
applicable, a GitHub link via email by 1700 on the date shown in the schedule
below. Please cc: in the whole class. The associated presentation will take
place on the same day during class.

### Outline

The following roles provide suggestions for the content and structure of the
report and presentation:

* [The Historians]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/historians.md %}). Understand
  the historical context of the paper; prior works, the authors biography, or
  the general technological/political/cultural context of the time.
* [The Technicians]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/technicians.md %}). Will be
  responsible for reading the paper with care and producing a summary
  presentation and report of the main results.
* [The Experimentalists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/experimentalists.md %}).
  If appropriate, will re-produce some of the results from the paper in a
  simple dynamic programming language, e.g. Python or MATLAB.
* [The Futurists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/futurists.md %}). Understand
  the impact of the paper in future academic research and in an industrial
  context. Discover how the presentation of the key ideas of the paper has
  evolved in e.g. modern textbooks.
* [Critics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link roles/critics.md %}). Will ‘critique’ the
  article in a constructive way, e.g. What was clear? What was not clear? Is
  the information laid out in a good order?  Are there any omissions?  Are the
  arguments strong? What could be improved?
